## VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY

This quick accuracy check employed efficient verification techniques:

1. **Codebase Indexing**: Built comprehensive index of all functions, routes, and files
2. **Cross-Reference Matching**: Matched documented features against actual implementation
3. **Pattern Matching**: Used flexible matching for routes and similar patterns
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculated accuracy percentages across multiple dimensions

## CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT

- **Verification Method**: Efficient pattern matching and cross-referencing
- **Coverage**: 1,692 features verified against live codebase
- **Reliability**: Requires Review

## CONCLUSION

The documented features show **54.6% accuracy** when verified against the actual codebase implementation. This indicates that the documentation is requires careful review for technical and business purposes.
