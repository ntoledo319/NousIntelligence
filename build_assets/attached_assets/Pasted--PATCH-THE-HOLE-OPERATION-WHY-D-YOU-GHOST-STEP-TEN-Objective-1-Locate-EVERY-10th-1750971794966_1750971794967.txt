### PATCH-THE-HOLE OPERATION: “WHY’D YOU GHOST STEP TEN?” ###

**Objective**

1. **Locate EVERY 10th-Step asset** hiding in the codebase (models, routes, templates, scheduled jobs, helper funcs, config flags).
2. **Inject them** into the “🔎 Complete Feature Index (Auto-Generated)” section of *executive_board_report3.md* (and any sibling reports).
3. **Root-cause autopsy:** figure out **why** the first sweep blanked on these assets—then adapt the scanner so it never bails on unseen features again.
4. **Re-scan & patch**: run the beefed-up scanner across the whole repo to snag **any other ninjas** the docs still ignore, and update the index.

#### 1. Recon pass: Hunt Step-10

* Grep + AST on patterns: `step10`, `inventory`, `spot_check`, `nightly_inventory`, `apology`, `"tenth"` (case-insensitive).
* Track:  
  – **Models**: class names + fields  
  – **Routes/blueprints**: HTTP verbs + paths  
  – **Cron/Celery/RQ tasks** scheduling Step-10 reminders  
  – **Templates/components** powering UI  
  – **Feature flags** gating availability

#### 2. Doc patch

* Open `/mnt/data/executive_board_report3.md`.  
* In **“🔎 Complete Feature Index (Auto-Generated)”**:  
  – Add/merge **Step 10 Nightly Inventory** (or whatever name matches code).  
  – List paths, one-liner what-it-does, main files.  
  – Preserve alphabetical order & 80-char wrap.  
* If same section exists in rev-1 or rev-2, patch them too for parity.  
* No new files; overwrite in-place.

#### 3. Why-did-we-miss Audit

* After scan, dump `MISSED_FEATURE_CAUSE.md` (temp file, auto-delete on success) explaining:  
  – **Signal** that tripped us up (e.g. unconventional naming, nested blueprint, dynamic registration, feature flagged off).  
  – The exact code examples where Step-10 hides.  
  – Fix implemented in scanner (e.g. add regex alias list, follow dynamic import graph, parse cron specs, respect flags).  

#### 4. Rescan & Deep-patch

* Rerun full scanner with new rules.  
* Diff feature list before/after; append any newcomers.  
* Echo `“Index refreshed — <timestamp> — <Δcount> new features captured”`.

---

**Constraints**

* `.replit` stays sacred; hands off.  
* Memory thrift: stream dir walks, avoid reading 100-MB assets into RAM.  
* New code files allowed ONLY for improved scanner utilities; delete temp logs post-run.  
* Fail loud on exceptions; don’t silently eat stack traces.
