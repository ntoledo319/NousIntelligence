🛠️ Role

You are a Refactor & Consolidation Engineer. Your job is to create one clean, authoritative landing flow for the app, then prune everything else.

🎯 Primary Objectives
	1.	Consolidate landing page, entry points, and workflows into one final, production-ready implementation.
	2.	Eliminate redundancy – delete obsolete components, dead routes, duplicate styles, outdated assets, and any files no longer referenced after consolidation.
	3.	Update all paths and imports repository-wide so every reference resolves to the new, single source of truth.
	4.	Keep the project runnable – tests pass, build succeeds, and dev server boots without warnings.
	5.	Commit results as one atomic PR with a clear summary of major changes.

📋 Detailed Task List
	1.	Inventory & Map Current State
	•	Parse repo directory tree.
	•	Locate every file whose name or content suggests: “landing”, “index”, “main”, “app”, “home”, “workflow”, or equivalent.
	•	Generate a mapping of which components/routes/assets feed each entry point.
	2.	Design the Unified Flow
	•	Choose the canonical landing component + route that is newest, most complete, or most widely referenced.
	•	Merge required markup, logic, and styling from other variants into this canonical file, preserving UX features & SEO tags.
	•	De-duplicate helper functions and constants; co-locate shared logic in sensible modules (e.g., src/lib/…).
	3.	Rip Out Redundancies
	•	Remove superseded landing pages, old workflow files, unused assets, stale tests, and any config blocks tied to deleted code.
	•	When in doubt, confirm via static analysis that a file has zero remaining imports/references before deleting.
	4.	Global Path / Import Updates
	•	Use repo-wide search-and-replace (respecting language import syntax) to point every reference to the new canonical paths.
	•	Fix relative vs absolute import mismatches introduced by moved files.
	5.	Verify Integrity
	•	Run full test suite (npm test, pnpm test, or appropriate command) and linter.
	•	Build the project (npm run build) to confirm zero compile errors or warnings.
	•	Spin up dev server; manually hit root and deep links to ensure routing works.
	6.	Commit & Document
	•	Stage all changed and deleted files.
	•	Write a concise commit message:
“chore(refactor): unify landing flow & purge redundant entry points 🧹”
	•	Push branch or open PR summarizing: which files were merged, which were removed, and any breaking changes (should be none).

⚠️ Constraints
	•	No partial commits – everything must pass tests before you push.
	•	Do not introduce new dependencies unless strictly necessary; prefer native / existing libs.
	•	Maintain git history clarity – don’t squash unrelated changes into this PR.
	•	If you generate TODO comments, prefix them with // TODO(agent): so teammates can track outstanding work.

✅ Definition of Done
	•	One authoritative landing page & workflow exists.
	•	No duplicate files or dead code paths remain.
	•	npm run start (or equivalent) loads the app to the new landing page without errors.
	•	All automated tests and linters pass.
	•	PR is pushed and ready for review.
