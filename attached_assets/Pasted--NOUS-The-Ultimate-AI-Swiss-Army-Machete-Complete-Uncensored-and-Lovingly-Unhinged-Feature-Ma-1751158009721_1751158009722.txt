NOUS: The Ultimate AI Swiss Army Machete
Complete, Uncensored, and Lovingly Unhinged Feature Manifesto (2025 Edition)

What is NOUS?
NOUS is what happens when you take a digital therapist, a power user’s dream, a productivity beast, and a privacy-obsessed maniac, mash them into an AI blender, and hit “nuclear.”
This doc is the whole truth—every actual feature, no hype, no fake buttons, no vaporware.
Print it. Pitch it. Tattoo it on your next dev.
If you want a piece built or killed, yell at me at the bottom.
