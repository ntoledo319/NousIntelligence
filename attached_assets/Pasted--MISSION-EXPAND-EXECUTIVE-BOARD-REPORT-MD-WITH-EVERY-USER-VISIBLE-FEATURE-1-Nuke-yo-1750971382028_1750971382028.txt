### MISSION: EXPAND EXECUTIVE_BOARD_REPORT*.MD WITH **EVERY** USER-VISIBLE FEATURE ###

1. **Nuke your assumptions.**   
   *Ignore all existing markdown except for its file path.*  
   Our truth source = live source code only.

2. **Full repo sweep.**  
   • Recursively scan /home/runner (or cwd) for *.py, *.js, *.html, *.sql, *.mdx.*  
   • Parse with AST/reflection; detect:  
     – Flask/FastAPI/Starlette blueprints & routes (`@app.route`, `Blueprint`, `router.*`)  
     – CLI commands, Celery/RQ/cron jobs, WebSocket events  
     – Models & schemas that surface UX (Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, dataclasses)  
     – Any public method with a `@doc`, `@expose`, or swagger/openapi tag  
     – Front-end components (React/HTMX/Vue) that hit those endpoints  
     – Feature flags & config toggles that gate user functions

3. **Build the feature ledger.**  
   For each discovered feature produce:  
   • **Name** – 3-5 word punchy title  
   • **What it does** – one-liner, active voice  
   • **Routes/Entry points** – HTTP verb + path (or CLI cmd / cron spec)  
   • **Primary files** – relative paths to the brains behind the magic  
   • **Dependencies** – internal modules or third-party libs worth noting

4. **Write back to docs (in place).**  
   • Update `/mnt/data/executive_board_report.md` (and *_report2.md* if present).  
   • Add / refresh a section called “🔎 Complete Feature Index (Auto-Generated)”.  
   • Table format, alphabetical, 80-char wrap max.  
   • Keep everything else in the doc verbatim—just insert/replace that one section.

5. **No clutter, no clones.**  
   • DO NOT create new doc files unless path missing entirely.  
   • Purge obsolete feature lines you don’t find in code.  
   • If a doc section duplicates another, merge and delete the twin.  
   • Log any deleted section names to console for diff review.

6. **Ship it.**  
   • On successful overwrite, echo “Feature index regenerated: <timestamp>”.  
   • If parser hits errors, fail loud with stack trace—no silent skips.

### CONSTRAINTS ###
* Leave `.replit` untouched.  
* Create NEW source files only when refactoring helpers is absolutely required; otherwise reuse & patch.  
* Conserve RAM / tokens: stream results, chunk large dirs.
